# Codsoft Java Projects

Welcome to the Codsoft Java Projects repository! This collection features various programming tasks developed using Java to enhance coding skills and understanding of different concepts. Below is a summary of each task.

 Task 1: Number Guessing Game
This Java program implements a number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it's too high, too low, or correct. Users can play multiple rounds, and a scoring system tracks their performance based on the number of attempts taken.

 Task 2: Marks Calculation System
This task involves a Java program that takes marks obtained in various subjects (out of 100) as input. It calculates total marks, computes the average percentage, and assigns grades based on the performance achieved.

 Task 3: ATM Interface
This Java application builds an ATM interface allowing users to perform banking operations such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking their balance. The program implements methods for account management and includes input validation to ensure acceptable transaction limits.

 Task 4: Quiz Application
This Java-based quiz application presents multiple-choice questions to users, implements a timer for responses, and keeps track of scores. The application displays a summary of results at the end of the quiz.

 Task 5: Course Management System
Developed in Java, this course management system stores information about courses and students. It allows students to register for courses, view available slots, and drop courses they have registered for.
